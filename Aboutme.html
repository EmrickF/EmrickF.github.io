            Hello. <br>My name is Erik and i'm a beginner programmer with 1 year of experience. I started programming
            cause
            it looked cool and interesting whilst providing good pay. <br>
            I live in Finland but i mostly speak Swedish.
            <br>

            I
            play alot of video games aswell
            which also were one of the reasons i wanted to start programming.
            <br>
            One of my main interests is watching and reading alot of Anime, Mangas and Light novels these past few
            years
